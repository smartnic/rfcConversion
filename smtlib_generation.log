Explanation:

We declare the `Message` sort and the `has_sequence_number` function that takes a message and an integer representing the sequence number. We use a universally quantified variable `m` ranging over messages and existentially quantified variable `n` ranging over integers to express that for every message there exists some integer as its sequence number. This captures the requirement that each TCP segment should have a sequence number.

Explanation:

This SMT-LIB expression declares the necessary sorts `Node` and `Message`, as well as the predicate `has_window_size`. It then asserts that there exists a message `m` with a real value `w` representing its window size, which means that some message has a window size. This captures the idea that a TCP endpoint has a window size since messages exchanged between endpoints contain window sizes.

```
Explanation:

We start by declaring the necessary sorts `Message` and `Port`. We also declare a new binary predicate `has_destination_port`, which states that a given message has a specific destination port. Then we use an implication within our universal quantifier to say that for every message `m` of sort `Message`, if `m` is a valid TCP segment (as per the `is_valid_segment` predicate), then there should be a destination port associated with it through the `has_destination_port` predicate.

      (has_socket x))))

Explanation:
We declare two sorts, Node and Bool. We also declare three uninterpreted functions: is_tcp_endpoint, has_socket, and the implication operator =>. The function is_tcp_endpoint represents whether a node is a TCP endpoint or not. The function has_socket determines if a given node (TCP endpoint) has a socket. Using the forall quantifier, we create an implication stating that for every node x, if x is a TCP endpoint then it must have a socket.

```
Explanation:

We declare the `Message` sort and the `has_sequence_number` function that takes a message and an integer representing the sequence number. We use a universal quantifier to iterate over all messages, and for each message, we assert the existence of some integer as its sequence number using an existential quantifier.

(assert (exists ((m Message)) (has_flag m "SYN")))
```

Explanation:
We declare two sorts `Node` and `Message`, as well as a unary function `has_flag` that takes a message and returns true if it has the specified flag. We use the `assert` command to define our requirement. Our requirement states that every TCP segment must either have or not have the SYN flag. However, since we know that there should be at least one SYN segment according to the problem statement, we add an additional constraint using the `exists` keyword to ensure that such a segment exists.

      (exists ((n Number))
        (has_ack_number m n)))))
```
Explanation:

This SMT-LIB expression checks that for every message `m`, if it has the ACK flag set, then there should be an acknowledgment number associated with that message. This captures the requirement that an ACK segment must contain an ACK flag.

Here's how we break down the components:

1. We declare the necessary sorts and functions required for our problem domain, including declaring messages as well as predicates such as `has_flag` and `has_ack_number`.
2. Using the `assert` command, we specify the primary constraint regarding ACK segments having the ACK flag.
3. Inside the `assert` statement, we use a universal quantifier (`forall`) to iterate through each message `m`. If the message has the ACK flag set, we require the existence (using the existential quantifier `exists`) of some acknowledgement number `n` associated with that message via the `has_ack_number` predicate.

```
Explanation:
We declare sorts for `Node` and `State`. We also declare unary predicates `is_tcp_endpoint` and `in_state`, which represent whether an object is a TCP endpoint and whether a given node is in a specific state, respectively. Finally, we use a universally quantified statement to claim that every node (x) must be in some state (s).

              )
))
```
Explanation:

We start by declaring the necessary sorts `Node` and `WindowSize`. We use the integer sort for simplicity as window sizes are typically represented as integers in practice. Then we declare our binary predicate `has_window_size`, which indicates that a given node has a specific windows size value. Our SMT-LIB expression uses a universally quantified implication to specify that for every node `x` of sort `Node`, if `x` is an instance of a TCP endpoint, then there should be some window size value `w` associated with it through the `has_window_size` relationship.

```
Explanation:

We declare the necessary sorts `Node`, `Port`, and functions `has_source_port`. We use the universal quantifier `forall` to iterate over every message `m`, and then we apply the existential quantifier `exists` to find a source port `p` associated with that message. This captures the requirement that each TCP segment has a source port.

```
Explanation:

We declare two sorts, `Message` representing the type of messages and `Int` representing integers as ports. We also declare a unary predicate `has_destination_port`, which indicates whether a given message contains a specific destination port.

In our SMT-LIB expression, we use a universally quantified variable `m` ranging over messages, and an existentially quantified variable `p` ranging over integers. This captures that for every message there should be some integer value corresponding to its destination port.

```
Explanation:
We declare sorts for `Node` and `State`. We also declare unary predicates `is_tcp_endpoint` and `in_state`, which represent whether an object is a TCP endpoint and whether a given node is in a specific state, respectively. Finally, we use a universally quantified statement to claim that every node (x) must be in some state (s).
