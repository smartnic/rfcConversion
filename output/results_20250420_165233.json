        "is_valid_segment(m)",

      ],
      "explanation": "This FOL expression states that for every message m that is a valid TCP segment, there exists some sequence number n such that m has that sequence number. This captures the requirement since it implies that if a message is a valid TCP segment, then it must have a sequence number."

      "explanation": "This formula states that for every message m, if it has the SYN flag set then it indeed has the SYN flag set. Although this seems trivial, remember that we're working within the constraints of first-order logic where each statement should be unambiguous and self-contained. Here, we quantify over all messages m, ensuring our rule applies universally."

      "explanation": "This formula states that for every message m that has an acknowledged number (regardless of its value, denoted by the underscore), it must also have the ACK flag set. This captures the requirement that an ACK segment must have the ACK flag set since having an acknowledged number implies that the message is indeed an ACK segment."

This captures the requirement that a TCP endpoint in the CLOSED state ignores all segments since processing a segment would involve setting up a new connection or responding to an existing one, which should not be done while in the CLOSED state."

      "explanation": "This FOL expression captures the requirement that a TCP endpoint must send an ACK for every received segment. It uses universal quantification over all nodes (x), messages (m), and other nodes (y). The antecedent states that if a node x receives a message m from another node y, then there exists an acknowledgement message (a) such that it has the ACK flag set and is sent by node x back to node y. This ensures that whenever a segment is received, an acknowledgement will be sent as required."
