      "explanation": "This FOL expression states that for every message m, if it has a sequence number (has_sequence_number(m)), then there exists some value n such that message m has sequence number n (has_sequence_number(m, n)). This captures the requirement that a TCP segment should have a sequence number since we've assumed that having a sequence number means associating a specific value with the message."

      "explanation": "This FOL expression states that for every message m, if it is a valid TCP segment then having the SYN flag implies that the message indeed has the SYN flag set. This captures the requirement since a SYN segment should definitely have a SYN flag according to the definition of a SYN segment in the TCP protocol."
