We use the `assert` command to define our requirement. Our requirement states that every TCP segment must either have or not have the SYN flag. However, since we know that there should be at least one SYN segment according to the problem statement, we add an additional constraint using the `exists` keyword to ensure that such a segment exists."

We declare the necessary sorts and functions required for our problem domain, including declaring messages as well as predicates such as `has_flag` and `has_ack_number`.\n2. Using the `assert` command, we specify the primary constraint regarding ACK segments having the ACK flag.\n3. Inside the `assert` statement, we use a universal quantifier (`forall`) to iterate through each message `m`. If the message has the ACK flag set, we require the existence (using the existential quantifier `exists`) of some acknowledgement number `n` associated with that message via the `has_ack_number` predicate."
