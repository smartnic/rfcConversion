      "explanation": "We declare the `Message` sort and the `has_sequence_number` function that takes a message and an integer representing the sequence number. We use a universally quantified variable `m` ranging over messages and existentially quantified variable `n` ranging over integers to express that for every message there exists some integer as its sequence number. This captures the requirement that each TCP segment should have a sequence number."

      "explanation": "This SMT-LIB expression declares the necessary sorts `Node` and `Message`, as well as the predicate `has_window_size`. It then asserts that there exists a message `m` with a real value `w` representing its window size, which means that some message has a window size. This captures the idea that a TCP endpoint has a window size since messages exchanged between endpoints contain window sizes."

      "explanation": "We start by declaring the necessary sorts `Message` and `Port`. We also declare a new binary predicate `has_destination_port`, which states that a given message has a specific destination port. Then we use an implication within our universal quantifier to say that for every message `m` of sort `Message`, if `m` is a valid TCP segment (as per the `is_valid_segment` predicate), then there should be a destination port associated with it through the `has_destination_port` predicate."

The function is_tcp_endpoint represents whether a node is a TCP endpoint or not. The function has_socket determines if a given node (TCP endpoint) has a socket. Using the forall quantifier, we create an implication stating that for every node x, if x is a TCP endpoint then it must have a socket."
