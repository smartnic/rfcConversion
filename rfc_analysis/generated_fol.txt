RFC Statement 1:
"The sequence number field is a 32-bit number that identifies the first data octet in this segment."
================================================================================
FOL Expression:
∀m, n, x. (is_tcp_segment(m) ∧ has_sequence_number(m, n) → is_first_data_octet(n, x))

Explanation:
For every TCP segment m with a sequence number n, there exists an identification of the first data octet x in the segment. This means that if a TCP segment has a sequence number, then it uniquely identifies the first data octet in this segment.

Failed to generate complete response after all retries.

RFC Statement 3:
"A TCP connection is established by the exchange of a SYN, a SYN-ACK, and an ACK."

Failed to generate complete response after all retries.

RFC Statement 4:
"If no acknowledgment is received before the timer expires, the segment is retransmitted."

Failed to generate complete response after all retries.

RFC Statement 5:
"The window field is a 16-bit field that specifies the size of the receive window."
================================================================================
FOL Expression:
∀m,w. (is_valid_segment(m) ∧ has_window_size(m, w) → 0 ≤ w ∧ w ≤ 65535)

Explanation:
This FOL expression states that for every message m which is a valid TCP segment and has a window size value w, it holds true that the window size should be between 0 and 65535 inclusive. This represents the 16-bit field limitation as well as non-negativity of the window size.
