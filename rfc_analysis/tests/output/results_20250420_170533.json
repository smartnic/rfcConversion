      "explanation": "This statement says that for all messages m, if m is a valid TCP segment and it has the SYN flag set, then we can conclude that m is a SYN segment specifically. This captures the idea that having the SYN flag set is what makes a segment a SYN segment."

This captures the requirement that an ACK segment should indeed contain an acknowledgement number as indicated by its ACK flag being set. The underscore (_) indicates that we don't care about the specific value of the acknowledgement number; only its presence matters in this context."
