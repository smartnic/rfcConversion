# RFC to FOL Converter Improvements

## Overview of Improvements

The original script (`print_clean_prompts.py`) has been improved and refactored into `improved_print_clean_prompts.py` with the following enhancements:

### 1. Security Improvements
- Removed hardcoded API token in favor of environment variables
- Added support for loading API token from `.env` file using python-dotenv
- Added fallback mechanism with appropriate warnings when no token is provided

### 2. Code Organization
- Modularized code into smaller, focused functions with clear responsibilities
- Added comprehensive type hints for better code readability and IDE support
- Moved configuration constants to the top of the file for easier maintenance
- Improved function and variable naming for clarity

### 3. Error Handling
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types
- Added proper timeout handling for API requests
- Improved logging with more detailed error messages
- Created a dedicated logging setup function with configurable paths

### 4. Performance & Reliability
- Consolidated retry mechanisms into a single, consistent approach
- Added proper validation of API responses
- Improved response parsing and cleaning
- Added better file handling with proper directory creation

## How to Use the Improved Script

### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Hugging Face API token:
   ```
   HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Script

```bash
python -m rfc_analysis.tests.improved_print_clean_prompts
```

The script will:
1. Load RFC statements from `rfc_statements.json` if available, or use default statements
2. Process each statement to generate FOL conversions
3. Save results to the `output` directory
4. Log detailed information to the `logs` directory

### Output

The script generates several outputs:
- Console output showing progress and results
- `output/generated_fol.txt` containing successful conversions
- `output/failed_generations.txt` containing failed conversions
- `output/results_TIMESTAMP.json` containing structured results
- Log files in the `logs` directory
